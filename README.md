### Hi there 👋

### Who I am? 🧑‍💻
I'm a Software Developer currently pursuing a Master’s in Software Engineering at Universidad de los Andes.
I work in a Data Tech team, where I design and develop RESTful APIs using FastAPI, focusing on clean, maintainable, and efficient backend architectures.

With over 5 years of experience building web applications in Python (Flask, Django, FastAPI) and JavaScript, I’m passionate about improving code quality, adopting best practices, and continuously learning new technologies to enhance my craft.

Before fully transitioning into software development, I spent 8+ years as a Senior Network Engineer, specializing in network protocols (MPLS, BGP, IP, DHCP), security, and troubleshooting across large-scale telecommunications environments.
My background as an Electronic Engineer with hands-on experience in Linux and IoT projects shaped my problem-solving mindset and system-level understanding.

🌱 Currently learning: Go, React, Node.js, MongoDB  
💡 Interests: Software architecture, clean code, and backend scalability  
🧠 Goal: Keep improving my engineering skills to design maintainable, high-quality systems
